# Moodle Local Kopere BI

This plugin was developed to provide visual and interactive data analysis for Moodle environments, enabling educators and administrators to better understand student performance and engagement.

## Features

Kopere BI offers a variety of options to present data, including diverse charts and formats:

#### Available Charts

Kopere BI uses [**ApexCharts**](https://apexcharts.com/) to provide a variety of interactive and customizable chart options, allowing for clear and dynamic data visualization. The available chart types include:

- **Area Charts**: Ideal for visualizing trends over time, showing the magnitude of data relative to time. Perfect for analyzing student progress.
- **Column Charts**: Useful for comparing different categories or groups. Column charts help highlight the relative performance of different classes or modules.
- **Line Charts**: Excellent for tracking progress over time, making it easy to identify patterns and fluctuations in student performance.
- **Pie Charts**: Perfect for representing parts of a whole, allowing you to visualize the percentage distribution of data clearly and intuitively.

In addition to a wide range of chart types, ApexCharts offers customization options such as colors, animations, and interactivity, allowing you to tailor the data presentation to your needs.


#### Data Presentation

Data can be displayed in different formats:

- **HTML**: With Mustache support, you can show data in any format and layout desired.
- **Info**: Small, visually appealing blocks that display key information clearly.
- **Maps**: A map that shows the location of users based on their IP address.

#### Additional Formats

- **Table**: Data can be presented in a tabular format with support for [DataTables](https://datatables.net/). This provides clear and organized data visualization, including features such as:
  - **Pagination**: Splits large datasets into pages for easier navigation.
  - **Filtering**: Real-time search to quickly locate specific information.
  - **Sorting**: Allows column sorting for better data analysis.
  - **Export**: Data can be exported in various formats, including:
      - **Print**: Allows printing the table directly from the interface while maintaining formatting.
    - **PDF**: Generates a PDF document of the table for easy sharing.
    - **Excel**: Exports data to an Excel file for further analysis.
    - **CSV**: Exports data in CSV format for importing into other applications.
    - **Copy to Clipboard**: Copies data directly to the clipboard for easy pasting into other applications.

Table columns can be customized using [Mustache](https://moodledev.io/docs/guides/templates), allowing you to format and display the data as needed, including applying custom data.
